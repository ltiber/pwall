    <h2> What is pwall App?</h2>
    
    
<p>pwall is modern style photo viewer and organizer.
    It shows the <i>folders</i> of your photos main directory
    in the left pane and a <i>photowall</i> in the right.</p>
    <p> The directories are <i>descending</i> sorted.</p>
    <p>The photowall is a <i>scrolling</i> panel of square thumbnails
giving a preview of each photo. Loading and unloading of this 
        scrolling panel is made <i>dynamically</i>, viewing page by viewing page
        like <i>smartphones</i> do.
        To scroll through your photo library, you can select a folder in the left panel or scroll <i>directly</i> in the photowall. Going down and up will lead you to <i>next or previous</i> directory.</p>
<p>
    pwall also allows you to have basics <i>management</i> of photos (change dates, copy a group of photos to another directory, delete, share, get GPS data...) but doesn't have edit functions.</p>
    <p>The photowall shows the photos in a descending sorted on the file <i>modification date</i> for each directory. If your modification date doesn't represent the <i>taken date</i>, you can use the change dates facilities to get the correct sorting.</p>
    <p> Clicking on a photo opens it in <i>fullscreen</i> mode. You can continue your navigation in this mode with <i>left and right keys</i>. </p>
    <p>pwall supports only jpg and png files. But for my usage, it was enough.</p>
    <p>pwall <i>doesn't import</i> photos in a specific database. It only uses the file system and can handle smoothly 50000 photos with a modern laptop.</p>
    <p>You can use pwall as an <i>alternative</i> to Shotwell to browse your photo gallery.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>
    <h3>Main menu</h3>
   <ul>
       <li><i>Refresh Thumbnails</i>: This process will create <span foreground=\"#EC8156\">thumbnails</span> for all <span foreground=\"#EC8156\">your photos</span>. It can be long!!! The app uses thumbnails to display photo walls and it can take time to create one for each photo. On basic laptop, it can take 7mn to generate thumbnails for 10000 photos. Each thumbnail costs about 10ko and is stored in you home dir in the .pwall subdir. The best thing is to run once at first time or when you renew massively your photos. Updates will be done based on file's last modified date. Nevertheless feel free to cancel this operation if it is not the right moment.The app will create thumbnails <span foreground=\"#EC8156\">on the fly.</span> But the UI might <span foreground=\"#EC8156\">freeze</span> some time to time.</li>
       <li><i>Change photos directory</i> gives you the option to specify again the location of your photos library</li>
       <li>Help gives you access to this current help.</li>
    </ul>      
    
    <h3>Actions in the directory tree</h3>
    <p>Note that when you open the app or when you select a new directory to display, the <i>focus</i> leaves the tree panel and goes directly to the photowall. This means that you can scroll directly with keys up and down to catch the photo you need. The drawback is that you never get the focus a long time in the tree panel.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Just click on a <i>directory</i> to view its photowall</li>
            <li>Ctrl-left put the focus on the directory tree and go up and down in the tree with keys. Mind the directory is refreshed 300ms after the new dir selection. So if you move quickly with key up and down to a directory, the app won't load the in between directories in the photowall to save time and be smoother.</li>
            <li>Ctrl-F to <i>search</i> in the directory tree. It will also hide the searchbar when it is no more needed.</li>
            <ul>

                <li>To go to next result if any, use buttons</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Right click on a directory to open the <i>context menu</i></li>
            <ul>
