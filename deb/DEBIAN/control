Description:  pwall is modern style photos/videos viewer and organizer.
 It shows the folders of your photos/videos main directory
 in the left pane and a photowall in the right.
 The photowall is a scrolling panel of square thumbnails
 giving a preview of each photo/video. Loading and unloading of this 
 scrolling panel is made dynamicaly, viewing page by viewing page
 like smartphones do.
 It also allows you to have basics management of photos/video
 (change dates, copy a group of photos to another directory, delete, share, get GPS data...).
 Clicking on a photo/video opens it in fullscreen mode. You can continue your navigation in this mode with left and right keys. 
 I use it as an alternative to Shotwell.
